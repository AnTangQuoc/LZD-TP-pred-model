    "\n",
    "Previous studies developing logistic regression models for LI-TP risk predictions have included 4-6 predictors in their final models \\[[1](#ref-liu_analysis_2021)–[4](#ref-xu_establishment_2023)\\]. We expect to include about as many candidate predictors, based on results from the expert opinion survey and the Bayesian Model Selection algorithm <a href=\"#sec-outcomes-and-predictors\" class=\"quarto-xref\">see 3.3</a>. Some of the candidate predictors might be continuous, which may potentially require non-linear modelling and therefore slightly increase the number of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general rule of thumb is for at least 10 events be available for each candidate predictor considered in a prediction model \\[[5](#ref-peduzzi1995)\\]. We have a total of 816 eligible patients and 264 of those have experienced the outcome. If the number of candidate predictors is 7, we would have 37 events per candidate predictor, which is considerably greater than the minimum number required. Even if the number of parameters screened is 20, we would still have 13 events per candidate predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the aforementioned rule of thumb have generated some debate in the literature, with recent results suggesting that event per variable criterion is too simplistic and has no strong relation to the predictive performance of a model. Riley et al \\[[6](#ref-riley2019)\\] proposed a different set of criteria to estimate minimum sample size for models developed using logistic regression, which are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Small optimism in predictor effect estimates, defined as a global shrinkage factor of \\>= 0.9.\n",
    "2.  Small absolute difference of \\<= 0.05 in the model’s apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke’s R-squared.\n",
    "3.  Precise estimation of the overall risk in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria 1 and 2 aims to reduce the potential of overfitting. Criteria 3 aims to ensure the overall risk is estimated precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2.1 Step 1: Choose the number of candidate predictors of interest for inclusion in the model, and calculate the corresponding number of predictor parameters (p)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one predictor may require two or more parameters. For example, a k-category predictor requires k-1 parameters and a continuous predictor model with a non-linear trend requires more than one parameter to be estimated. Also include any potential interaction terms towards the total p.\n",

    "Harmonisation between datasets was mainly done via manually recording data to a standardized form. Data was then entered into an Excel spreadsheet. Data cleaning was done by handling duplicates, checking for missing values and inconsistencies. Multiple linezolid treatment episodes in the same patient were treated as duplicates and only the first episode was included in the analysis. Patients with missing values were excluded from subsequent analyses. Inconsistencies were resolved by referring back to the original records.\n",

    "\n",
    "-   Patient demographics were limited to age in years, gender, and weight in kilograms.\n",
    "-   Clinical department was recorded into binary variables: intensive care unit, emergency department, and others.\n",
    "-   Co-morbidities were recorded into binary variables: hypertension, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular accident, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cirrhosis, malignancies, and hematological disorders.\n",
    "-   Invasive procedures were recorded into binary variables: endotracheal intubation, central venous catheter insertion, intermittent hemodialysis, and continuous renal replacement therapy.\n",
    "-   Infection type was recorded into binary variables: community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infection, central nervous system infection, intra-abdominal infection, urinary tract infection, bone and joint infection, septicemia, and sepsis.\n",
    "-   Laboratory results were limited to serum creatinine, hemoglobin count, white blood cell count, and platelet count. Creatinine clearance was estimated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.\n",
    "-   Linezolid route of administration was recorded into binary variables: intravenous, oral, and both.\n",
    "-   Linezolid dose in milligrams.\n",
    "-   Linezolid duration in days.\n",
    "-   Concomitant medications were recoded to binary variables: carbapenems, daptomycin, teicoplanin, levofloxacin, ibuprofen, naproxen, heparin, clopidogrel, enoxaparin, eptifibatide, carbamazepine, valproic acid, quetiapine, atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, trastuzumab, tacrolimus, fluorouracil, irinotecan, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, pyrazinamide, and rifampin.\n",
