However, the efficacy and safety of linezolid in the treatment of the elderly have not been well characterized. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of linezolid in the treatment of the elderly with gram-positive bacterial infection and to investigate the risk factors associated with the development of thrombocytopenia in these patients. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective analysis of 50 elderly patients who were treated with intravenous linezolid for gram-positive bacterial infection. Clinical data and bacteriological responses were assessed. Risk factors associated with thrombocytopenia in elderly patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The overall clinical cure rate of linezolid was 74%, and the bacteriological eradication rate was 69%. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 24 patients, and thrombocytopenia was associated with both the duration of treatment (P = 0.005) and the baseline platelet count (P = 0.042). Based on a logistic regression analysis, the baseline platelet count &amp;amp;amp;lt;200x10(9)/L (OR = 0.244; 95% CI = 0.068- 0.874; P = 0.030) was identified as the only significant risk factor for linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia in elderly patients. The mean platelet count decreased significantly from the 7(th) day of treatment, and decreased to the lowest value 1-2 days after the end of therapy. Conclusions : Linezolid is effective and safe for the elderly with gram-positive bacterial infections. Adverse effects such as thrombocytopenia are of greater concern. Platelet counts should be monitored in patients who are treated with linezolid and that measures should be taken in advance to avoid hemorrhagic tendencies.;,citation_author=L. Q.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Risk factors for thrombocytopenia in adult chinese patients receiving linezolid therapy;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Linezolid (LZD), an oxazolidinone antibiotic agent, has excellent activity and bioavailability against most methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant gram-positive bacteria. Although LZD is generally well tolerated, several studies have found adverse hematologic effects, of which thrombocytopenia is of most concern. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors for thrombocytopenia in patients who received oral or parenteral LZD therapy between February 1 and November 30, 2010. METHODS: Data were extracted retrospectively from the electronic medical records in our hospital information system. Thrombocytopenia was defined as either a final platelet count of &amp;amp;amp;lt;100 x 10(9)/L (criterion 1) or a 25% reduction from the baseline platelet count (criterion 2). Risk factors were determined using logistic regression analysis, and clinical features were predicted using receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The study included 254 patients, with mean (SD) age of 59 (17.66) years. The duration of LZD therapy was 9.43 (5.63) days. Thrombocytopenia developed in 69 patients (27.2%), as defined by criterion 1, and in 127 patients (50%), as defined by criterion 2. At univariate analysis, age, weight, creatinine clearance, serum albumin concentration, baseline platelet count, daily dosage, and concomitant use of caspofungin, levofloxacin, and meropenem were significant risk factors for thrombocytopenia. At multivariate analysis and using ROC curves, daily dose &amp;gt;/=18.75 mg/kg, baseline platelet count &amp;lt;/=181 x 10(9)/L, duration of LZD therapy &amp;gt;/=10 days, and concomitant use of caspofungin and levofloxacin were independent risk factors for thrombocytopenia as defined by criterion 1, whereas creatinine clearance </=88.39 mL/min/1.73 m(2), serum albumin concentration </=33.5 g/L, daily dose >/=18.46 mg/kg, and caspofungin were independent risk factors for thrombocytopenia as defined by criterion 2. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of LZD-related thrombocytopenia in the Chinese population is much higher than that suggested by the drug instructions. Low pretreatment platelet count, low body weight, low serum albumin concentration, long-term drug administration, advanced age, renal insufficiency, and concomitant use of caspofungin, levofloxacin, and meropenem have been identified as risk factors. Although predictors have been proposed for use in clinical practice to screen for patients at high risk who require intensified monitoring, further research on the dosage-based pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of LZD are urgently needed.;,citation_author=C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in patients without haemato-oncologic diseases;,citation_abstract=This study aimed to describe the occurrence and to evaluate the predictive factors of thrombocytopenia caused by parenteral linezolid in hospitalised patients without haemato-oncologic diseases. Using electronic medical records, a retrospective safety evaluation was performed among all hospitalised adult patients who received parenteral linezolid therapy between January 2005 and June 2016. Of all identified 264 patients with an average age of 63.4 (SD 15.8) years, thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 29.2% after an average of 11.2 (SD 7.4) days of the initiation of linezolid therapy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reappraisal of Linezolid Dosing in Renal Impairment To Improve Safety;,citation_abstract=Linezolid is administered as a fixed dose to all patients despite evidence of increased exposure and myelosuppression in renal impairment. The objectives of these studies were to assess the risk of thrombocytopenia with standard-dose linezolid in renal impairment and to identify an alternate dosing strategy. In study 1, data from adult patients receiving linezolid for &amp;amp;amp;gt;/=10 days were retrospectively reviewed to determine the frequency of thrombocytopenia in patients with and without renal impairment. Time-to-event analyses were performed using Cox proportional-hazards models. In study 2, population pharmacokinetic modeling was employed to build covariate-structured models using an independent data set of linezolid concentrations obtained during routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Monte Carlo simulations were performed to identify linezolid dosing regimens that maximized attainment of therapeutic trough concentrations (2 to 8 mg/liter) across various renal-function groups. Toxicity analysis (study 1) included 341 patients, 133 (39.0%) with renal impairment. Thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently among patients with renal impairment (42.9% versus 16.8%; P &amp;lt; 0.001), and renal impairment was independently associated with this toxicity in multivariable analysis (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52 to 3.68). Pharmacokinetic analyses (study 2) included 1,309 linezolid concentrations from 603 adult patients. Age, body surface area, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were identified as covariates of linezolid clearance. Linezolid dose reductions improved the probability of achieving optimal exposures in simulated patients with eGFR values of &amp;lt;60 ml/min. Thrombocytopenia occurs more frequently in patients with renal impairment receiving standard linezolid doses. Linezolid dose reduction and trough-based TDM are predicted to mitigate this treatment-limiting toxicity.;,citation_author=R. L. Crass;,citation_author=P. G. Cojutti;,citation_author=M. P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Analysis of the risk factors of linezolid-related haematological toxicity in Chinese patients;,citation_abstract=WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVES: Haematological toxicity including thrombocytopenia, anaemia and leucopenia is the main adverse events of linezolid (LZD) therapy. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for LZD-induced haematological toxicity and define the threshold of plasma trough concentration to minimize the haematological toxicity. METHODS: 145 patients who received LZD for more than 10 days were retrospectively reviewed to determine the incidence of LZD-induced haematological toxicity. Meanwhile, the risk factors of haematological toxicity were confirmed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 9 (6.2%) patients developed leucopenia, while 52 (35.9%) and 26 (17.9%) patients developed thrombocytopenia and anaemia, respectively. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &amp;amp;amp;lt;90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (OR, 2.744; 95% CI, 1.117-6.734; p = 0.028) and baseline platelet count &amp;lt;200 x 10(9) /L (OR, 6.817; 95% CI, 2.870-16.193; p < 0.0001) were found to be significant risk factors for LZD-related thrombocytopenia. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &amp;gt;80 U/L (OR, 4.844; 95% CI, 1.207-19.451; p = 0.026) and eGFR <90 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (OR, 7.132; 95% CI, 2.088-24.357; p = 0.002) were the risk factors for LZD-related anaemia. However, no significant risk factors were identified for LZD-related leucopenia. Moreover, LZD plasma trough concentration &amp;gt;8 mg/L [OR, 3.047; 95% CI, 1.233-7.539; p = 0.016] could be a predictor for the development of thrombocytopenia and anaemia.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Therapeutic drug monitoring and receiver operating characteristic curve prediction may reduce the development of linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia in critically ill patients;,citation_abstract=To investigate the risk factors associated with the development of thrombocytopenia, and define the thresholds of efficacy and safety in critically ill patients who received linezolid therapy. A retrospective study was performed in critically ill patients treated with linezolid. Risk factors associated with thrombocytopenia were identified via medical records and trough levels (C(min)) measured during linezolid treatment. By establishing a logistic model, the risks were predicted by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the thresholds of efficacy and safety were identified in the patients. Logistic analysis showed that, weight (OR = 0.906; 95% CI, 0.839-0.978; P = 0.011), baseline platelet count (OR = 0.989; 95% CI, 0.977-1.000; P = 0.049), C(min) (OR = 1.545; 95% CI, 1.203-1.983; P = 0.001), and APACHE II score (OR = 1.130; 95% CI, 1.003-1.273; P = 0.044) were significant factors for linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia. The area under the ROC curve of the combined predictor was larger based on the above factors. When the Youden index was the maximum, the best optimal cut-off point was 205.6 on the ROC curve; when C(min) &amp;amp;amp;gt;/= 2 mg/L, the probability of bacterial eradication was more than 80%; when C(min) &amp;gt;/= 6.3 mg/L, the probability of thrombocytopenia was more than 50 %. In clinical practice, when the calculating results of the combined predictor &amp;lt;/=205.6, the risk of the development of thrombocytopenia may be higher. Furthermore, maintenance of C(min) between 2 and 6.3 mg/L over time may be helpful in retaining appropriate efficacy and reducing the associated thrombocytopenia.;,citation_author=H. Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Regression Model to Predict Linezolid Induced Thrombocytopenia in Neonatal Sepsis Patients: A Ten-Year Retrospective Cohort Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia (LIT) is the main factor limiting the clinical application of linezolid (LZD). The incidence and risk factors of LIT in neonatal patients were possibly different from other populations based on pathophysiological characteristics. The purpose of this study was to establish a regression model for predicting LIT in neonatal sepsis patients. Methods: We retrospectively included 518 patients and divided them into the LIT group and the non-LIT group. A logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the factors related to LIT, and a regression model was established. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the model’s predictive value. We prospectively collected 39 patients’ data to validate the model and evaluate the effect of LZD pharmacokinetics on LIT. Results: Among the 518 patients, 103 patients (19.9%) developed LIT. The Kaplan-Meier plot revealed that the overall median time from the initiation of LZD treatment to the onset of LIT in preterm infants was much shorter when compared with term infants [10 (6, 12) vs. 13 (9.75, 16.5), p = 0.004]. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors of LIT were lower weight at medication, younger gestational ages, late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, mechanical ventilation, longer durations of LZD treatment, and lower baseline of platelet level. We established the above seven-variable prediction regression model and calculated the predictive probability. The ROC curve showed that the predicted probability of combined body weight, gestational age, duration of LZD treatment, and baseline of platelet had better sensitivity (84.4%), specificity (74.2%), and maximum AUC (AUC = 0.873). LIT occurred in 9 out of 39 patients (23.1%), and the accuracies of positive and negative predictions of LIT were 88.9 and 76.7%, respectively. Compared with the non-LIT patients, the LIT patients had higher trough concentration [11.49 (6.86, 15.13) vs. 5.51 (2.80, 11.61) mg/L; p = 0.028] but lower apparent volume of distribution (Vd) [0.778 (0.687, 1.421) vs. 1.322 (1.099, 1.610) L; p = 0.010]. Conclusion: The incidence of LIT was high in neonatal sepsis patients, especially in preterm infants. LIT occurred earlier in preterm infants than in term infants. The regression model of seven variables had a high predictive value for predicting LIT. LIT was correlated with higher trough concentration and lower Vd.;,citation_author=L. Duan;,citation_author=Q.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in adult inpatients;,citation_abstract=Background Previous reports about risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia have been insufficient, often due to the variability in study design and population, and some factors have not yet been studied. Aim The aims of this study are to determine potential risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia, and to analyze the influencing factors of different thrombocytopenia definitions. Method This retrospective study involved patients who were administered intravenous linezolid for &amp;amp;amp;gt;/= 1 day between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2021. Their demographic and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. Thrombocytopenia was defined as: 1 in circlethrombocytopenia with platelet count &amp;lt; 100 x 10(9)/L and a decrease in 25% or more from baseline of the platelet count (criterion 1); 2 in circlethrombocytopenia due to a platelet count drop decrease of 25% or more from baseline (criterion 2). Risk factors were determined via binary logistic regression analysis. Results This study included 320 patients. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that baseline platelet count (p &amp;lt; 0.001), linezolid therapy duration (p = 0.001) and shock (patients require vasoactive medications) (p = 0.019) were independent risk factors for criterion-1thrombocytopenia, while linezolid therapy duration (p < 0.001) and shock (p = 0.015) were independent risk factors for criterion-2 thrombocytopenia. There was also a significant correlation between shock and early-onset thrombocytopenia (p = 0.005 and 0.019 for criterion 1 and criterion 2, respectively). Conclusion Linezolid therapy duration and shock were common causes of different thrombocytopenia definitions; shock was correlated with early-onset thrombocytopenia.

We aimed to identify the risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia and anemia. We retrospectively retrieved demographic and laboratory data from the medical records of 221 Japanese patients who were undergoing linezolid therapy. Thrombocytopenia and anemia were defined as an unexplained reduction of &amp;amp;amp;gt;30% in the patient’s platelet count and hemoglobin level, respectively, from the baseline. Thrombocytopenia developed in 48.4% of patients, and anemia developed in 10.4% of patients during linezolid therapy. In multivariate analysis, creatinine clearance (adjusted odds ratio = 0.94 [0.92-0.95], P &amp;lt; 0.001), hemodialysis (3.32 [1.14-9.67], P = 0.011), and the duration of linezolid therapy (1.14 [1.07-1.21], P &amp;lt; 0.001) were found to be significant risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. Patients with creatinine clearance rates of <60 mL/min and those on hemodialysis were found to be at high risk of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. In addition, a high incidence of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia was even detected among the patients that had received linezolid therapy for <7 days. As for anemia, the duration of linezolid therapy (1.04 [1.01-1.07], P = 0.011) was shown to be a risk factor for anemia, and a high incidence of anemia was seen among the patients who received linezolid for &amp;gt;15 days. In conclusion, we recommend that among patients receiving linezolid therapy the platelet counts of those with risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia should be monitored closely throughout treatment, and the hemoglobin levels of patients that receive linezolid for >15 days should be carefully monitored on a weekly basis to detect anemia.;,citation_author=Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Retrospective analysis of the risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in adult Japanese patients;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia is a major side effect of linezolid therapy. However, there are few reports about the risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk factors for thrombocytopenia in patients who undergo linezolid therapy. SETTING: Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital in Japan, a tertiary 695 beds hospital. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed using the hospital’s medical records. From January 2010 to August 2012, 75 adult patients who received linezolid therapy were enrolled in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia was defined as a decrease in the patient’s platelet count to &amp;amp;amp;lt;10 x 10(4)/muL or a reduction of &amp;gt;/=30 % from their baseline value. Odds ratios (OR) for thrombocytopenia were analyzed using multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia occurred in 29 patients (38.6 %), seven of whom required platelet transfusions. The patients who developed thrombocytopenia were significantly older, displayed a significantly higher frequency of renal insufficiency, and received linezolid therapy for significantly longer than the patients without thrombocytopenia. Stepwise logistic regression analysis suggested that receiving linezolid therapy for &amp;gt;/=14 days was a significant risk factor for thrombocytopenia [OR 13.3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3.2-55.6, p &amp;lt; 0.01], whereas the creatinine clearance rate exhibited a significant negative correlation with the incidence of the condition [OR 0.98, 95 % CI 0.96-0.99, p = 0.037]. The incidence of thrombocytopenia among the patients who demonstrated creatinine clearance rates of <30 mL/min was 60 % (12/20), which was significantly higher than that observed among the patients who displayed creatinine clearance rates of more than 60 mL/min (26.4 %, 9/34, p = 0.014).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The association between risk factors and time of onset for thrombocytopenia in Japanese patients receiving linezolid therapy: A retrospective analysis;,citation_abstract=WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Linezolid (LZD) is an oxazolidinone antibiotic that is active against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. The major adverse effect related to its use in humans is reversible myelosuppression, which mostly manifests as thrombocytopenia. This retrospective study was conducted to identify risk factors that might contribute towards the development of thrombocytopenia due to intravenous administration of LZD. METHOD: Patients who were administered LZD between January 2008 and March 2013 were included. Thrombocytopenia was defined as a decrease in platelet count of &amp;amp;amp;gt;/=10 x 10(4) cell/muL from baseline or of &amp;gt;/=30%. RESULTS: A total of 47 patients were included in this study. These patients were divided into two groups: 22 patients (46.8%) were assigned to a non-thrombocytopenia group and 25 patients (53.2%) to a thrombocytopenia group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed significant intergroup differences in duration of LZD treatment [odds ratio (OR) = 1.278; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.068-1.529; P = 0.007] and white blood cell (WBC) count (>12000 cells/muL; OR = 10.399; 95% CI = 1.667-64.882; P = 0.012).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Risk factors for linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia and negative effect of carbapenem combination;,citation_abstract=INTRODUCTION: Linezolid is a synthetic antimicrobial agent with a broad spectrum of activity against virtually all Gram-positive bacteria. Although linezolid is generally well tolerated, the prolonged use of linezolid can lead to myelosuppression, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The aim of this study was investigating the risk factors for thrombocytopenia in patients who received linezolid therapy. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study was performed on patients who received linezolid therapy between July 2007 and December 2017. Thrombocytopenia was defined as either a platelets count of &amp;amp;amp;lt; 100x109/L or a 25% reduction from the baseline platelet count. RESULTS: A total of 371 patients, (198 (53%) male and 173(47%) female were included into the study. Mean duration of therapy was 12.81 +/- 5.19 days. Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia was detected in a total of 111 patients. Using the univariate analysis advanced sex, serum urea concentration, baseline platelet level and low eGFR value were found to be risk factors for linezolid associated thrombocytopenia (p &amp;lt; 0.05). According to a multivariate analysis, patients undergoing carbapenem treatment combination therapy (p = 0.003) and with a baseline platelet level of < 200x109/L (p = 0.00) were found to have a high risk of developing thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: Several factors may influence of linezolid associated thrombocytopenia. Platelet count should be monitored during therapy and thrombocytopenia should be kept in mind in patients with baseline platelet level of < 200x109/L, low eGFR, linezolid-carbapenem combination therapy.;,citation_author=E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia increases mortality risk in intensive care unit patients, a 10 year retrospective study;,citation_abstract=WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia is one of the many confounding conditions in critically ill patients. It is rare but prognostic importance of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in ICU population has not been well investigated. The study is to assess the incidence and risk factors of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in ICU patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study with ICU patients treated with linezolid between January 2005 and December 2015 at the adult medical, surgical, emergency, and neurological ICUs at 1500-bed tertiary university medical center. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There were 60 patients (mean age: 69.8 +/- 11.9), 29 (48.3%) who developed linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia determined by the Naranjo algorithm on a case-by-case basis during the study period. The patients with linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia had a higher rate of any malignancy (41.4% vs 9.7%, P = 0.007), elevated baseline creatinine levels (median [interquartile range; IQR]: 1.7 mg/dL [0.9-2.5] vs 0.9 mg/dL [0.6-1.3]; P = 0.042), and lower baseline platelet counts (median [IQR] 160 x 10(9) /L [128-230] vs 194 x 10(9) /L [118-285]; P = 0.296) than patients without linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. The patients who developed thrombocytopenia received more platelet transfusions (34.5% vs 6.5%, P = 0.009) and had higher ICU mortality rates (62.1% vs 32.3%, P = 0.037). Logistic regression analysis revealed the following significant risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia: presence of any malignancy (odds ratio; OR [95% confidence interval; CI]: 8.667 [1.986-37.831]) and an elevated baseline serum creatinine level (OR: 1.673, CI: 1.046-2.675]). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients with any malignancy or an elevated baseline creatinine level who were treated with linezolid in the ICU were more likely to develop thrombocytopenia.

The odds ratios (OR) for thrombocytopenia were obtained using multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 66 patients were included (mean age [SD] 62 [18], male gender [%], 37 [56]). LZD-associated TP was identified in 12 patients (18.2%).

All patients with Gram-positive infections treated with linezolid for more than 7 days were included. Data were collected from medical charts and differences between patients with and without renal insufficiency were analysed. Sixty-two patients (40 men), with a mean age of 56.9 years, were enrolled in this study. At the start of linezolid treatment, 17 patients (27.4%) had impaired renal function. Patients with renal insufficiency had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus compared with those with normal renal function (64.7% vs. 22.2%; P=0.002). At the start of therapy, patients with renal impairment had a higher frequency of elevated blood urea nitrogen (51.0+/-21.1mg/dL vs. 18.3+/-9.7mg/dL; P&amp;lt;0.001), elevated serum creatinine (2.3+/-0.7mg/dL vs. 0.9+/-0.3mg/dL; P&amp;lt;0.001) and decreased initial haemoglobin (9.2+/-1.5g/dL vs. 10.4+/-1.7g/dL; P=0.017).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Risk factors for linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia in adult patients;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVES: Thrombocytopenia (TP) is a common adverse effect of linezolid (LZD). However, risk factors for LZD-associated TP have been reported in Western patients with relatively heavy body weight. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for LZD-associated TP in Asian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 101 consecutive patients who received LZD therapy (1,200 mg/day) between July 2003 and December 2013 at a tertiary referral hospital in Tokyo, Japan. The patients with obvious other causes for TP were excluded. The information of target infectious disease, patients’ age, gender, body weight, body mass index, baseline serum creatinine (SCr), baseline platelet count, and treatment duration was collected retrospectively. TP was defined as &amp;amp;amp;gt;/= 50% decrease in platelet count from baseline. Bi- and multi-variate analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were included (mean age [SD] 64 [18]; male gender [%], 57 [56]). Median duration [range] of LZD therapy was 14 days [1-67]. LZD-associated TP was identified in 42 patients (42%). For TP, adjusted odds ratio (OR) [95% CI] of daily per kg dose (DPKD) and SCr was 1.14 [1.05-1.26] and 1.51 [1.01-2.50], respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Higher DPKD and elevated SCr are significantly associated with LZD-associated TP. These findings suggest that daily dose of LZD should be adjusted using body weight, as typically done in pediatrics, in adults as well.

In the subsequent intervention study, in which daily dose of linezolid was set to 20 mg/kg in patients with either one of the risk factors or 1200 mg in those without any risk factor, the onset of thrombocytopenia was significantly prolonged in the intervention study group (P = 0.043), without reducing clinical efficacy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=High plasma linezolid concentration and impaired renal function affect development of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVES: Thrombocytopenia is sometimes observed during linezolid therapy. Here, we aimed to investigate the factors affecting linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed between October 2009 and February 2011; 30 patients were included. Plasma linezolid trough concentrations were measured on days 3, 7 and 14 after initial drug administration. Platelet counts and haemoglobin levels were also monitored. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia occurred in 17 patients (56.7%). Median linezolid trough concentrations on day 3 were significantly higher in patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance &amp;amp;amp;lt;60 mL/min) than in patients without renal impairment (14.7 versus 4.8 mg/L; P &amp;lt; 0.0001). Median linezolid trough concentrations on day 3 in patients who developed thrombocytopenia were also significantly higher than those in patients who did not (13.4 versus 4.3 mg/L, P < 0.0001). Development of thrombocytopenia occurred significantly more frequently in patients with linezolid trough concentration &amp;gt;7.5 mg/L (OR, 90.0; P < 0.0001) and renal impairment (OR, 39.0; P = 0.0002). The Kaplan-Meier plot showed that the median time from the initiation of therapy to development of thrombocytopenia was 11 days. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with renal impairment are more likely to have a high plasma linezolid concentration. In addition, a high plasma linezolid concentration and renal impairment significantly affected the development of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia.

However, some patients do not develop thrombocytopenia despite long-term administration of LZD. To determine the risk factors for LZD-associated thrombocytopenia in patients undergoing long-term LZD therapy, we conducted a retrospective cohort study among 212 patients receiving LZD treatment between December 2011 and June 2014 at a tertiary referral university hospital in Nagoya, Japan. Of the 217 patients who received LZD, 37 were treated with LZD for more than 14 days and were enrolled in the study. We compared data on demographic characteristics, underlying disease, microbiology, concomitant drugs, and laboratory tests between the thrombocytopenia group and the non-thrombocytopenia group. Thrombocytopenia was defined as having a platelet count &amp;amp;amp;lt; 100 × 10(3)/μL or a ≥ 50% reduction in platelet count compared to baseline. Among the 37 patients who received LZD for more than 14 days, 17 (45.9%) developed thrombocytopenia. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that both the number of concomitant drugs with thrombocytopenic adverse effects (DTADE) (OR = 1.690; 95% CI = 1.037-2.754; P = 0.035) and a small decrease in the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) 14 days post-administration (OR = 0.965; 95% CI = 0.939-0.993; P = 0.013) were associated with thrombocytopenia during long-term LZD therapy. Therefore, the number of concomitant DTADE and a small decrease in CRP on the 14th day of treatment were key factors for the appearance of LZD-associated thrombocytopenia in patients with long-term LZD therapy.

Thrombocytopenia was defined as a &amp;amp;amp;gt;/= 10 x 10(4) cells/mm(3) decrease from the baseline or a &amp;gt;/= 30% reduction. Thirty-three variables were analyzed as risk factors associated with thrombocytopenia. Multivariate analysis was performed with SPSS version 16 software. This study included 331 patients (221 male, 58.0 +/- 20.2 years). The mean duration of linezolid therapy was 10.5 +/- 8.7 days. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 128 patients (38.7%), of whom 21 required platelet transfusion. Thrombocytopenia developed 7.4 +/- 4.8 days after linezolid initiation, and the platelet count recovered 12.3 +/- 7.8 days after withdrawal. In the final steps of stepwise logistic regression analysis, 5 variables were selected: duration of linezolid therapy >/= 14 days [odds ratio (OR) 3.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73-5.34, P &amp;lt; 0.001], creatinine clearance &amp;lt; 50 mL/min (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.45-3.74, P < 0.001), chronic liver disorders (OR 1.63, 95% CI 0.92-2.86, P = 0.092), and respiratory tract infections (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.05-2.91, P = 0.031). In contrast to findings with parenteral administration, oral administration of linezolid decreased the risk of thrombocytopenia (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.97, P = 0.042). The time to the onset of thrombocytopenia in patients with creatinine clearance <50 mL/min was significantly shorter than that in patients with creatinine clearance >/= 50 mL/min (6.7 +/- 4.4 and 8.5 +/- 5.2 days, P = 0.039), and in patients administered orally the time to the onset of thrombocytopenia was 10.4 +/- 6.6 days. Several factors influenced the occurrence of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. Dose adjustment may be required in at-risk patients, especially those with renal dysfunction.;,citation_author=Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A retrospective test for a possible relationship between linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia and hyponatraemia;,citation_abstract=WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: Thrombocytopenia is one of the typical adverse events caused by linezolid (LZD). Recently, some cases of severe hyponatraemia occurring while receiving LZD have been reported. This study investigated a possible relationship between LZD-induced hyponatraemia and thrombocytopenia and identified the risk factors for hyponatraemia and/or thrombocytopenia. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre, observational cohort study, 63 hospitalized patients aged over 18 years who received intravenous injection of LZD for more than seven consecutive days in Oita University Hospital between April 2015 and March 2018 were analysed. RESULTS: Thrombocytopenia occurred in 25 (39.7%) patients and hyponatraemia in 11 (17.5%) patients. Seven of 11 patients with hyponatraemia had concurrent thrombocytopenia. Although both serum sodium level and platelet count declined in most patients who developed hyponatraemia, no significant association between thrombocytopenia and hyponatraemia was found. Creatinine clearance level (Ccr) was significantly lower not only in the thrombocytopenia (vs no-thrombocytopenia) but also in the hyponatraemia group (vs no-hyponatraemia group). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified different risk factors for thrombocytopenia and/or hyponatraemia (thrombocytopenia: Ccr and administration period; hyponatraemia: serum albumin; thrombocytopenia and hyponatraemia: administration period and serum albumin). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study found no significant relationship between LZD-induced thrombocytopenia and hyponatraemia and identified some possible risk factors associated with onset of the two adverse events.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Clinical Use and Adverse Drug Reactions of Linezolid: A Retrospective Study in Four Belgian Hospital Centers;,citation_abstract=In Belgium, linezolid is indicated for pneumonia and skin and soft tissue infections, but is more broadly used, due to its oral bioavailability and activity against multiresistant organisms. This could increase the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADR), notably hematological disorders (anemia, thrombocytopenia), neuropathy, or lactic acidosis. We analyzed linezolid clinical use in relationship with occurrence of ADR in Belgian hospitals and highlighted risk factors associated with the development of thrombocytopenia. A retrospective analysis of electronic medical records and laboratory tests of adult patients treated with linezolid in four Belgian hospitals in 2016 allowed the collection of ADR for 248 linezolid treatments. Only 19.7% of indications were in-label. ADR included 43 thrombocytopenia, 17 anemia, 4 neuropathies, and 4 increases in lactatemia. In a multi-variate analysis, risk factors of thrombocytopenia were a treatment duration &amp;amp;amp;gt; 10 days, a glomerular filtration rate &amp;lt; 60 mL/min, and a Charlson index &amp;gt;/= 4. Off-label use of linezolid is frequent in Belgium, and ADR more frequent than reported in the summary of product characteristics, but not statistically associated with any indication. This high prevalence of ADR could be related to a high proportion of patients presenting risk factors in our population, highlighting the importance of detecting them prospectively.;,citation_author=H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=High frequency of linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia and anemia among patients with end-stage renal disease;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Data about the efficacy and tolerability of linezolid for the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are lacking. METHODS: This retrospective case-control study compared the tolerability and efficacy of linezolid therapy for patients with ESRD and patients with non-end-stage renal disease (NESRD), all of whom had gram-positive bacterial infections. RESULTS: There were 58 men and 33 women enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 61.5 years (range, 45.4-81.2 years). Among these patients, 28 (30.8%) were receiving hemodialysis at the start of linezolid treatment. The ESRD group had a higher percentage of patients with diabetes mellitus (57.1% vs. 33.3%; P = .029) and an older mean age (+/-SD) (72.1 +/- 10.8 years vs. 56.8 +/- 20.4 years; P &amp;amp;amp;lt; .001), compared with the NESRD group. Severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count, &amp;lt; 100 x 10(9) platelets/L) and anemia were significantly more frequent in the ESRD group, compared with the NESRD group (78.6% vs. 42.9% [P = .003] and 71.4% vs. 36.5% [P = .003], respectively). The independent risk factors for thrombocytopenia identified by logistic regression analysis were pretreatment disease severity score (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95%, confidence interval [CI], 1.13-1.60; P = .001), central catheter-related infection (OR, 4.96; 95% CI, 1.08-22.73; P = .046), and ESRD (OR, 6.14; 95% CI, 1.63-23.26; P = .007). ESRD was the only independent risk factor for anemia (OR, 4; 95% CI, 1.50-10.64; P = .006). Survival analysis for the development of thrombocytopenia or death showed significant differences between patients with ESRD and patients with NESRD (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The lower tolerability of linezolid in patients with ESRD, compared with those with NESRD, is evidenced by the higher rates of thrombocytopenia and anemia in the former group. The severity of these conditions necessitates treatment discontinuation for patients with ESRD more often than for patients with NESRD.;,citation_author=V. C. Wu;,citation_author=Y. T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=High frequency of thrombocytopenia in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure treated with linezolid;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Linezolid is an effective antibiotic reagent for Gram-positive bacterial infection; its most common side effect is thrombocytopenia. However, the incidence of thrombocytopenia in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) who underwent linezolid therapy was unclear. The present study was to evaluate the incidence of thrombocytopenia in ACLF and non-ACLF patients treated with linezolid and the risk factors of thrombocytopenia in these patients. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with ACLF who had been subjected to intravenous administration of 600 mg linezolid every 12 hours for more than 7 days were categorized as a ACLF treatment (ACLF-T) group, 72 patients without ACLF treated with the same dosage of linezolid were recruited as a non-ACLF treatment (NACLF-T) group, and 70 patients with ACLF without linezolid treatment served as an ACLF control (ACLF-C) group. The incidences of thrombocytopenia in different groups were compared at day 14. Risk factors were investigated using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of thrombocytopenia at day 14 was significantly higher in the ACLF-T group than in the ACLF-C group (20/35 vs 24/70, P=0.025) and in the NACLF-T group (20/35 vs 9/72, P&amp;amp;amp;lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the ratio of platelet count (day 7/day 0)&amp;lt;1 (OR=10.021; P=0.012) and the baseline platelet count (OR=0.985; P=0.036) were independent risk factors of thrombocytopenia at day 14 of linezolid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of linezolid treatment should outweigh the risk of thrombocytopenia in patients with ACLF.

Setting ZhongShan Hospital, FuDan University, China. Method A retrospective study was performed in patients aged ≥ 65 years receiving linezolid therapy from January 2015 to April 2021. Clinical characteristics and demographic data were collected and compared between patients with LI-TP and those without. Main outcome measures Incidence and risk factors of LI-TP in elderly patients. Results A total of 343 inpatients were included as the train set from January 2015 to August 2020. Among them, 67 (19.5%) developed LI-TP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that baseline platelet counts &amp;amp;amp;lt; 150×109·L-1 (OR=3.576; P&amp;lt; 0.001), age ≥ 75 years (OR=2.258; P=0.009), eGFR< 60 mL·(min·1.73m2)-1 (OR=2.553; P=0.002), duration of linezolid therapy ≥ 10 d (OR=3.218; P<0.001), ICU admittance (OR=2.682; P=0.004), and concomitant with piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) (OR=3.863; P=0.006) were independent risk factors for LI-TP. The risk predictive model was established and exhibited a moderate discriminative power, with an AUC of 0.795 [95%CI 0.740-0.851] and 0.849 [95%CI 0.7600.939] in train set (n=343) and validation set (n=90), respectively.

OBJECTIVES: To identify the real-life frequency of new-onset thrombocytopenia due to linezolid and to determine the associated risk factors. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted among consecutive inpatients at a tertiary care hospital who received linezolid for a minimum of 5 days between January 2013 and August 2017. Data were extracted from electronic medical records obtained from a hospital database. Thrombocytopenia was defined as platelet count less than 100 × 109/L or a 50% reduction from baseline (i.e., before linezolid initiation). Risk factors were identified by comparing the characteristics of patients who experienced the adverse effect during linezolid therapy with those of patients who did not experience the adverse effect. Continuous data were analyzed with the t test and categorical data with the χ2 test. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were included (38 women, 64 men; overall mean age 50 years, standard deviation [SD] 21). The mean duration of linezolid therapy was 14 (SD 10) days. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 18 patients (17.6%).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Linezolid Dosing in Patients With Liver Cirrhosis: Standard Dosing Risk Toxicity;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Limited data regarding altered linezolid pharmacokinetics in patients with liver cirrhosis are available. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of linezolid in cirrhotic patients. METHODS: A case-control 1:1 study of patients undergoing linezolid therapeutic drug monitoring was conducted between January 2015 and June 2017. Cases with liver cirrhosis were matched with controls by age, body weight, comorbidities, renal function, and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were included, 26 in each group. Patients with Child-Pugh Scores A, B, and C were 1 (3.8%), 13 (50.0%), and 12 (46.2%), respectively. Cases had higher median linezolid trough plasma concentrations than controls [20.6 (17.4) versus 2.7 (11.3); P &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.001)] and more frequently achieved an optimal pharmacodynamic index [26 (100%) versus 16 (61.5%); P = 0.002]. In addition, potentially toxic concentrations and treatment discontinuation due to overexposure and hematological toxicity were also more frequently seen in cirrhotic patients. Overall clinical cure rate was high (67.4%), and in-hospital mortality was 28.8%. No differences in clinical outcomes were observed between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid showed a high clinical cure rate. Nevertheless, plasma concentrations and treatment discontinuation due to hematological toxicity were higher in cirrhotic patients.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic simulation for the quantitative risk assessment of linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia;,citation_abstract=What Is Known and Objective Linezolid (LZD) may cause thrombocytopenia, which can result in discontinuation of treatment. In this study, the blood LZD trough concentration was estimated based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters derived from two previously published models in the Japanese population to determine the rate of achieving the target trough value when the risk of thrombocytopenia is low and to clarify its relationship with the onset of thrombocytopenia. Methods This study included adult patients hospitalized at Shimane University Hospital, who received LZD treatment for at least 4 days from January 2010 to December 2017. Patients whose platelet count fell below 70% before LZD administration were categorized as the thrombocytopenic group. Patient PK parameters were calculated based on the population PK models described by Matsumoto et al. and Sasaki et al., and these parameters were designated A and B, respectively. Based on these parameters, the rate of achieving an LZD trough concentration of less than 8 μg/ml, which is the safety target achievement rate, was calculated using a random simulation for each patient. We further analysed the association between the incidence of thrombocytopenia and patient factors, including safety target achievement rate, through univariate, multivariate, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Results and Discussion Patients (n = 77) aged 72 ± 11 years and weighing 56.7 ± 10.9 kg, with a creatinine clearance (CLcr) of 60.5 ± 47.2 ml/min and a cirrhosis prevalence of 9.1%, were analysed. All patients received LZD at a dose of 600 mg twice daily for a total of 10.9 ± 8.9 days. Univariate analyses revealed significant differences (p &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.05) in the duration of LZD therapy, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, LZD clearance, and the safety target achievement rate for parameters A and B between the thrombocytopenic and non-thrombocytopenic groups. A multivariate analysis of these factors stratified with the cutoff values obtained by ROC analysis revealed that the duration of LZD therapy and the safety target achievement rates for parameters A and B were significant factors (odds ratios for duration of LZD therapy: 7.436 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.918–28.831] and 4.712 [95% CI: 1.567–14.163]; odds ratio for safety target achievement rate: 0.060 [95% CI: 0.016–0.232] and 0.167 [95% CI: 0.056–0.498] for parameters A and B, respectively). When the safety target achievement rates for patients treated with LZD were compared between the thrombocytopenic and non-thrombocytopenic groups, the safety target achievement rate was higher in the non-thrombocytopenic group in both the patients treated with LZD for less than 10 days and those for 10 days or more. Therefore, the safety target achievement rate estimated by the PK/PD simulation may represent to be an important index for risk assessment of LZD-induced thrombocytopenia. What Is New and Conclusion The risk of LZD-induced thrombocytopenia, which increased with the duration of LZD therapy, may be predicted using the safety target achievement rate obtained by the blood concentration simulation.;,citation_author=Tetsushu Onita;,citation_author=Noriyuki Ishihara;,citation_author=Amika Ikebuchi;,citation_author=Takahisa Yano;,citation_author=Nobuhiro Nishimura;,citation_author=Hiroki Tamaki;,citation_author=Kazuro Ikawa;,citation_author=Norifumi Morikawa;,citation_author=Kohji Naora;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcpt.13747;,citation_issue=12;,citation_doi=10.1111/jcpt.13747;,citation_issn=1365-2710;,citation_volume=47;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Towards a better detection of patients at-risk of linezolid toxicity in clinical practice: A prospective study in three Belgian hospital centers;,citation_abstract=Introduction: Linezolid is a last-resort antibiotic for infections caused by multidrug-resistant microorganisms. It is widely used for off-label indications and for longer than recommended treatment durations, exposing patients at higher risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), notably thrombocytopenia. This study aimed to investigate ADR incidence and risk factors, identify thrombocytopenia-related trough levels based on treatment duration, and evaluate the performance of predictive scores for ADR development.Methods: Adult in- and outpatients undergoing linezolid therapy were enrolled in three hospitals and ADRs and linezolid trough levels prospectively monitored over time. A population pharmacokinetic (pop-PK model) was used to estimate trough levels for blood samples collected at varying times.Results: A multivariate analysis based on 63 treatments identified treatment duration ≥10&nbsp;days and trough levels &amp;amp;amp;gt;8&nbsp;mg/L as independent risk factors of developing thrombocytopenia, with high trough values correlated with impaired renal function. Five patients treated for &amp;gt;28&nbsp;days did not develop thrombocytopenia but maintained trough values in the target range (&amp;lt;8&nbsp;mg/L). The Buzelé predictive score, which combines an age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index with treatment duration, demonstrated 77% specificity and 67% sensitivity to predict the risk of ADR.Conclusion: Our work supports the necessity of establishing guidelines for dose adjustment in patients with renal insufficiency and the systematic use of TDM in patients at-risk in order to keep trough values ≤8&nbsp;mg/L. The Buzelé predictive score (if ≥7) may help to detect these at-risk patients, and pop-PK models can estimate trough levels based on plasma samples collected at varying times, reducing the logistical burden of TDM in clinical practice.;,citation_author=Hélène Thirot;,citation_author=David Fage;,citation_author=Antonia Leonhardt;,citation_author=Philippe Clevenbergh;,citation_author=Tatiana Besse-Hammer;,citation_author=Jean Cyr Yombi;,citation_author=Olivier Cornu;,citation_author=Caroline Briquet;,citation_author=Maya Hites;,citation_author=Frédérique Jacobs;,citation_author=Gert-Jan Wijnant;,citation_author=Sebastian G.

METHODS: All enrolled patients received a standard dose (600&nbsp;mg every 12&nbsp;h) of linezolid and underwent therapeutic drug monitoring. The Child-Pugh-Turcotte score was used to divide patients into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment. The risk factors for linezolid overexposure (Cmin &amp;amp;amp;gt; 8&nbsp;mg/L) and linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia were examined using logistic regression. And the Kaplan-Meier curve was used to describe the association between linezolid overexposure and linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were included, 37 (48.1%) of whom experienced linezolid overexposure. Patients with severe hepatic impairment had a substantially higher median Cmin of linezolid than those with mild (20.7&nbsp;mg/L vs 5.51&nbsp;mg/L, P &amp;lt; 0.001) or moderate (20.7&nbsp;mg/L vs 6.70&nbsp;mg/L, P = 0.001) hepatic impairment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Use of Japanese big data from electronic medical records to investigate risk factors and identify their high-risk combinations for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia;,citation_abstract=PURPOSE: Thrombocytopenia is a major event associated with linezolid (LZD) therapy. Factors affecting LZD-induced thrombocytopenia (LIT) have been reported in previous studies. However, several issues pertaining to LIT have not yet been clarified. In the present study, we used Japanese big data to investigate associated factors and their high-risk combinations that influence LIT. METHODS: Patients administered LZD between May 2006 and October 2020 were included in this study. LIT was defined as either a 30% or more reduction from the baseline platelets or platelet values of &amp;amp;amp;lt; 100,000/µL. We evaluated factors affecting LIT and combinations of factors that alter LIT risk according to a decision tree (DT) analysis, a typical machine learning method. RESULTS: We successfully enrolled 1399 patients and LIT occurred in 44.7% of the patients (n = 626). We classified the laboratory data on renal function, LZD duration, age, and body weight (BW) into smaller categories. The results of multivariate analysis showed that prolonged LZD therapy, BW &amp;lt; 45&nbsp;kg, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30&nbsp;mL/min/1.73 m2, and dialysis were risk factors for LIT. The DT analysis revealed that the highest risk was a combination of LZD duration ≥ 14&nbsp;days and eGFR < 30&nbsp;mL/min/1.73 m2. CONCLUSIONS: The present study extracted four risk factors and identified high-risk combinations for LIT.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Regression Model to Predict Linezolid Induced Thrombocytopenia in Neonatal Sepsis Patients: A Ten-Year Retrospective Cohort Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia (LIT) is the main factor limiting the clinical application of linezolid (LZD). The incidence and risk factors of LIT in neonatal patients were possibly different from other populations based on pathophysiological characteristics. The purpose of this study was to establish a regression model for predicting LIT in neonatal sepsis patients. Methods: We retrospectively included 518 patients and divided them into the LIT group and the non-LIT group. A logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the factors related to LIT, and a regression model was established. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the model’s predictive value. We prospectively collected 39 patients’ data to validate the model and evaluate the effect of LZD pharmacokinetics on LIT. Results: Among the 518 patients, 103 patients (19.9%) developed LIT. The Kaplan-Meier plot revealed that the overall median time from the initiation of LZD treatment to the onset of LIT in preterm infants was much shorter when compared with term infants [10 (6, 12) vs. 13 (9.75, 16.5), p = 0.004]. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors of LIT were lower weight at medication, younger gestational ages, late-onset sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, mechanical ventilation, longer durations of LZD treatment, and lower baseline of platelet level. We established the above seven-variable prediction regression model and calculated the predictive probability. The ROC curve showed that the predicted probability of combined body weight, gestational age, duration of LZD treatment, and baseline of platelet had better sensitivity (84.4%), specificity (74.2%), and maximum AUC (AUC = 0.873). LIT occurred in 9 out of 39 patients (23.1%), and the accuracies of positive and negative predictions of LIT were 88.9 and 76.7%, respectively. Compared with the non-LIT patients, the LIT patients had higher trough concentration [11.49 (6.86, 15.13) vs. 5.51 (2.80, 11.61) mg/L; p = 0.028] but lower apparent volume of distribution (Vd) [0.778 (0.687, 1.421) vs. 1.322 (1.099, 1.610) L; p = 0.010].

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Establishment and validation of a risk prediction model incorporating concentrations of linezolid and its metabolite PNU142300 for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia is the main factor restricting the clinical application of linezolid. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between PNU-14230 concentration and linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia and further develop and validate a risk model for predicting linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. METHODS: A regression model was constructed to predict the occurrence of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia, and further externally validated. The predictive performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Linezolid Cmin and PNU-142300 concentrations were compared for different kidney function groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the difference in cumulative incidence of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia among different kidney function patients. RESULTS: In the derivation (n = 221) and validation (n = 158) cohorts, 28.5% and 24.1% of critically ill patients developed linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the independent risk factors were linezolid Cmin, PNU-142300 concentration, baseline platelet count, renal insufficiency (RI) and continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH). The AUC for the risk model was 0.901, and the model was good (P = 0.633). The model also showed good discrimination (AUC 0.870) and calibration (P = 0.282) in the external validation cohort. Compared with normal kidney function patients, patients with RI and CVVH had higher linezolid Cmin and PNU-142300 concentrations (P &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and higher cumulative incidence of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia (P &amp;lt; 0.001).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Classification Tree Analysis Based On Machine Learning for Predicting Linezolid-Induced Thrombocytopenia;,citation_abstract=Linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia is related to linezolid exposure, baseline platelet count and patient background. Although the relationship usually reflects the time of onset of thrombocytopenia, if the platelet maturation process is taken into account, the platelet decrease can be considered to have started at the beginning of treatment. To predict linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia, classification and regression tree (CART) analysis based on machine learning has been applied to identify predictive factors and cutoff values. We examined 74 patient data with or without linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. Linezolid concentration and platelet count change, baseline platelet count, age, body weight and creatinine clearance estimate were evaluated as predictive factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. CART analysis selected the final tree containing two cutoff values: a platelet count reduction to less than 2.3% from baseline at 96&nbsp;h after the initial dose and a linezolid concentration greater than or equal to 13.5&nbsp;mg/L at 96&nbsp;h after the initial dose.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Nomogram prediction model called &amp;amp;amp;quot;ADPLCP&amp;quot; for predicting linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia in elderly individuals;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Linezolid-associated thrombocytopenia (LAT) leads to drug withdrawal associated with a poor prognosis. Some risk factors for LAT have been identified; however, the sample size of previous studies was small, data from elderly individuals are limited, and a simple risk score scale was not established to predict LAT at an early stage, making it difficult to identify and intervene in LAT at an early stage. METHODS: In this single-center retrospective case-control study, we enrolled elderly patients treated with linezolid in the intensive care unit from January 2015 to December 2020. All the data of enrolled patients, including demographic information and laboratory findings at baseline, were collected. We analyzed the incidence and risk factors for LAT and established a nomogram risk prediction model for LAT in the elderly population. RESULTS: A total of 428 elderly patients were enrolled, and the incidence of LAT was 35.5% (152/428). Age ≥80&nbsp;years old (OR=1.980; 95% CI: 1.179-3.325; P=0.010), duration of linezolid ≥ 10 days (OR=1.100; 95% CI: 1.050-1.152; P&nbsp;&amp;amp;lt;0.0001), platelet count at baseline (100-149×109/L vs. ≥200×109/L, OR=8.205, 95% CI: 4.419-15.232, P&nbsp;&amp;lt;0.0001; 150-199 ×109/L vs. ≥200×109/L, OR=3.067, 95% CI: 1.676-5.612, P&nbsp;<0.001), leukocyte count at baseline ≥16×109/L (OR=2.580; 95% CI: 1.523-4.373; P&nbsp;<0.0001), creatinine clearance <50&nbsp;mL/min (OR=2.323; 95% CI: 1.388-3.890; P=0.001), and total protein <60&nbsp;g/L (OR=1.741; 95% CI: 1.039-2.919; P=0.035) were associated with LAT. The nomogram prediction model called &amp;quot;ADPLCP&quot; (age, duration, platelet, leukocyte, creatinine clearance, protein) was established based on logistic regression. The area under the curve (AUC) of ADPLCP was 0.802 (95% CI: 0.748-0.856; P&nbsp;<0.0001), with 78.9% sensitivity and 69.2% specificity (cut-off was 108). Risk stratification for LAT was performed based on &quot;ADPLCP.&quot; Total points of <100 were defined as low risk, and the possibility of LAT was <32.0%. Total points of 100-150 were defined as medium risk, and the possibility of LAT was 32.0-67.5%. A total point &amp;gt;150 was defined as high risk, and the probability of LAT was &amp;gt;67.5%. CONCLUSIONS: We created the ADPLCP risk score scale to predict the occurrence of LAT in elderly individuals. ADPLCP is simple and feasible and is helpful for the early determination of LAT to guide drug withdrawal or early intervention.;,citation_author=Yanxin Liu;,citation_author=Jiang Wang;,citation_author=Tingting Liu;,citation_author=Kun Xiao;,citation_author=Peng Yan;,citation_author=Xiangqun Fang;,citation_author=Lixin Xie;,citation_publication_date=2023-07;,citation_cover_date=2023-07;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.jointm.2022.12.003;,citation_issn=2667-100X;,citation_pmid=37533813;,citation_volume=3;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Intensive Medicine;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prediction of risk factors for linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia based on neural network model;,citation_abstract=Background: Based on real-world medical data, the artificial neural network model was used to predict the risk factors of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia to provide a reference for better clinical use of this drug and achieve the timely prevention of adverse reactions.Methods: The artificial neural network algorithm was used to construct the prediction model of the risk factors of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia and further evaluate the effectiveness of the artificial neural network model compared with the traditional Logistic regression model.Results: A total of 1,837 patients receiving linezolid treatment in a hospital in Xi ‘an, Shaanxi Province from 1 January 2011 to 1 January 2021 were recruited. According to the exclusion criteria, 1,273 cases that did not meet the requirements of the study were excluded. A total of 564 valid cases were included in the study, with 89 (15.78%) having thrombocytopenia. The prediction accuracy of the artificial neural network model was 96.32%, and the AUROC was 0.944, which was significantly higher than that of the Logistic regression model, which was 86.14%, and the AUROC was 0.796. In the artificial neural network model, urea, platelet baseline value and serum albumin were among the top three important risk factors.Conclusion: The predictive performance of the artificial neural network model is better than that of the traditional Logistic regression model, and it can well predict the risk factors of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia.;,citation_author=Xian Zhao;,citation_author=Qin Peng;,citation_author=Dongmei Hu;,citation_author=Weiwei Li;,citation_author=Qing Ji;,citation_author=Qianqian Dong;,citation_author=Luguang Huang;,citation_author=Miyang Piao;,citation_author=Yi Ding;,citation_author=Jingwen Wang;,citation_publication_date=2024;,citation_cover_date=2024;,citation_year=2024;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1292828;,citation_issn=1663-9812;,citation_volume=15;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Pharmacology;">

Patients hospitalized and treated with linezolid were included. The following patients were excluded: (i) those under 18 years of age; (ii) those treated with linezolid for less than 3 days; (iii) those without any recorded platelet count in the period before or after initiation of linezolid therapy; (iv) those with baseline platelet count of &gt; 450 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L; (v) those with any missing recorded values among the specified predictors. Each patient was included only once per admission and the first linezolid treatment course was evaluated.

<p>Thrombocytopenia may occur within a few days after stopping LZD, when the drug hasn’t been completely eliminated. However, it is unknown exactly how long after stopping LZD can a TP event still be attributed to LZD use. We deemed that any TP events that occur after 5 days of stopping LZD would not be related to LZD use.</p>
<p>Our rationale is that after 5 days (120 hrs), LZD is guaranteed to be completely eliminated in all patients, as the longest t<sub>1/2</sub> is 8.3 ± 2.4 hrs in end-stage renal disease patients, +3 SD would be ~16 hrs, so 120 hrs is &gt;7 half-lives, therefore in patients with the worst clearance, 99% of them would have 99% of the drug eliminated from their systems. Furthermore, trough LZD concentration (C<sub>min</sub>) has previously been identified as a predictor of LI-TP development, and LI-TP itself is mostly reversible after discontinuation, so we would argue that any TP events that occur after LZD has been eliminated from the system would not be related to LZD use.</p>

<p>Previous studies developing logistic regression models for LI-TP risk predictions have included 4-6 predictors in their final models <span class="citation" data-cites="liu_analysis_2021 duan_regression_2022 qin_development_2021 xu_establishment_2023">[<a href="#ref-xu_establishment_2023" role="doc-biblioref">2</a>,<a href="#ref-liu_analysis_2021" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>–<a href="#ref-qin_development_2021" role="doc-biblioref">6</a>]</span>. We expect to include about as many candidate predictors, based on results from the expert opinion survey and the Bayesian Model Selection algorithm. Some of the candidate predictors might be continuous, which may potentially require non-linear modelling and therefore slightly increase the number of variables.</p>
<p>A general rule of thumb is for at least 10 events be available for each candidate predictor considered in a prediction model <span class="citation" data-cites="peduzzi1995">[<a href="#ref-peduzzi1995" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>]</span>. We have a total of 816 eligible patients and 264 of those have experienced the outcome. If the number of candidate predictors is 7, we would have 37 events per candidate predictor, which is considerably greater than the minimum number required. Even if the number of parameters screened is 20, we would still have 13 events per candidate predictor.</p>
<p>However, the aforementioned rule of thumb have generated some debate in the literature, with recent results suggesting that event per variable criterion is too simplistic and has no strong relation to the predictive performance of a model. Riley et al <span class="citation" data-cites="riley2019">[<a href="#ref-riley2019" role="doc-biblioref">8</a>]</span> proposed a different set of criteria to estimate minimum sample size for models developed using logistic regression, which are the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Small optimism in predictor effect estimates, defined as a global shrinkage factor of &gt;= 0.9.</li>
<li>Small absolute difference of &lt;= 0.05 in the model’s apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke’s R-squared.</li>
<li>Precise estimation of the overall risk in the population.</li>
</ol>
<p>Criteria 1 and 2 aims to reduce the potential of overfitting. Criteria 3 aims to ensure the overall risk is estimated precisely.</p>

<p>Note that one predictor may require two or more parameters. For example, a k-category predictor requires k-1 parameters and a continuous predictor model with a non-linear trend requires more than one parameter to be estimated. Also include any potential interaction terms towards the total p.</p>

<p>The value of max(R<sup>2</sup><sub>CS_app</sub>) is based on the overall prevalence or overall rate of the outcome in the population of interest. The incidence of LI-TP in patients treated with linezolid was estimated to be 37% in a meta-analysis by Zhao et al <span class="citation" data-cites="zhao_prediction_2024">[<a href="#ref-zhao_prediction_2024" role="doc-biblioref">9</a>]</span>.</p>
<p>The value of R<sup>2</sup><sub>CS_adj</sub> could be based on that for a previously published model in the same setting and population (with similar outcome definition). However, as previous studies does not provide any information to identify a sensible value of the minimum expected Cox-Snell R<sup>2</sup>, the value R<sup>2</sup><sub>CS_adj</sub> will be assumed to correspond to a R<sup>2</sup><sub>Nagelkerke</sub> of 0.50, as baseline platelet count, a “direct” measurement of the outcome, is likely to be a predictor.</p>

<p>Harmonisation between datasets was mainly done via manually recording data to a standardized form. Data was then entered into an Excel spreadsheet. Data cleaning was done by handling duplicates, checking for missing values and inconsistencies. Multiple linezolid treatment episodes in the same patient were treated as duplicates and only the first episode was included in the analysis.
