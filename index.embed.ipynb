We expect to include about as many candidate predictors, based on results from the expert opinion survey and the Bayesian Model Selection algorithm \\[see @sec-outcomes-and-predictors\\]. Some of the candidate predictors might be continuous, which may potentially require non-linear modelling and therefore slightly increase the number of variables.\n",

We have a total of 816 eligible patients and 264 of those have experienced the outcome. If the number of candidate predictors is 7, we would have 37 events per candidate predictor, which is considerably greater than the minimum number required. Even if the number of parameters screened is 20, we would still have 13 events per candidate predictor.\n",

Furthermore, trough LZD concentration (C<sub>min</sub>) has previously been identified as a predictor of LI-TP development, and LI-TP itself is mostly reversible after discontinuation, so we would argue that any TP events that occur after LZD has been eliminated from the system would not be related to LZD use.\n",
