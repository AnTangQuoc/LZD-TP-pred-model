    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3a. Explain the healthcare context (including whether diagnostic or prognostic) and rationale for developing or evaluating the prediction model, including references to existing models\n",

    "**First paragraph:** introduction about linezolid and associated ADR including thrombocytopenia\n",

    "This study used data from three tertiary hospitals in Northern Vietnam: Thanh Nhan Hospital, Bach Mai Hospital, and the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases. Patients hospitalized and treated with linezolid were included. The following patients were excluded: (i) those under 18 years of age; (ii) those treated with linezolid for less than 3 days; (iii) those without any recorded platelet count in the period before or after initiation of linezolid therapy; (iv) those with baseline platelet count of \\> 450 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L; (v) those with any missing recorded values among the specified predictors. Each patient was included only once per admission and the first linezolid treatment course was evaluated. Included patients were followed up until the end of the linezolid treatment course or discharge date whichever comes first.\n",

    "## Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8a. Clearly define the outcome that is being predicted and the time horizon, including how and when assessed, the rationale for choosing this outcome, and whether the method of outcome assessment is consistent across sociodemographic groups\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of interest is linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia, defined as (i) a platelet count of \\< 112.5 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L (75% of the lower limit of normal) for patients with a baseline platelet count in the normal range; (ii) A reduction in platelet count of ≥ 25% from the baseline value for patients with a baseline platelet count of \\< 150 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L \\[@zyvoxpr; @xu_establishment_2023; @kawasuji_proposal_2021\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal platelet count is defined as 150-450 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L. Baseline platelet count is defined as the last recorded PLT value before the start of linezolid therapy. Participants are considered to have met the outcome if their platelet count value meets the above criteria at any time during linezolid therapy or within 5 days after the end of therapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Warning**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Thrombocytopenia may occur within a few days after stopping LZD, when the drug hasn’t been completely eliminated. However, it is unknown exactly how long after stopping LZD can a TP event still be attributed to LZD use. We deemed that any TP events that occur after 5 days of stopping LZD would not be related to LZD use.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Our rationale is that after 5 days (120 hrs), LZD is guaranteed to be completely eliminated in all patients, as the longest t<sub>1/2</sub> is 8.3 ± 2.4 hrs in end-stage renal disease patients, +3 SD would be ~16 hrs, so 120 hrs is \\>7 half-lives, therefore in patients with the worst clearance, 99% of them would have 99% of the drug eliminated from their systems. Furthermore, trough LZD concentration (C<sub>min</sub>) has previously been identified as a predictor of LI-TP development, and LI-TP itself is mostly reversible after discontinuation, so we would argue that any TP events that occur after LZD has been eliminated from the system would not be related to LZD use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8b. If outcome assessment requires subjective interpretation, describe the qualifications and demographic characteristics of the outcome assessors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8c. Report any actions to blind assessment of the outcome to be predicted\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predictors\n",

    "### 9a. Describe the choice of initial predictors (e.g., literature, previous models, all available predictors) and any pre-selection of predictors before model building\n",

    "## Sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Explain how the study size was arrived at (separately for development and evaluation), and justify that the study size was sufficient to answer the research question. Include details of any sample size calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies developing logistic regression models for LI-TP risk predictions have included 4-6 predictors in their final models \\[@liu_analysis_2021; @duan_regression_2022; @qin_development_2021; @xu_establishment_2023\\]. We expect to include about as many candidate predictors, based on results from the expert opinion survey and the Bayesian Model Selection algorithm. Some of the candidate predictors might be continuous, which may potentially require non-linear modelling and therefore slightly increase the number of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general rule of thumb is for at least 10 events be available for each candidate predictor considered in a prediction model @peduzzi1995. We have a total of 816 eligible patients and 264 of those have experienced the outcome. If the number of candidate predictors is 7, we would have 37 events per candidate predictor, which is considerably greater than the minimum number required. Even if the number of parameters screened is 20, we would still have 13 events per candidate predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the aforementioned rule of thumb have generated some debate in the literature, with recent results suggesting that event per variable criterion is too simplistic and has no strong relation to the predictive performance of a model. Riley et al @riley2019 proposed a different set of criteria to estimate minimum sample size for models developed using logistic regression, which are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Small optimism in predictor effect estimates, defined as a global shrinkage factor of \\>= 0.9.\n",
    "2.  Small absolute difference of \\<= 0.05 in the model’s apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke’s R-squared.\n",
    "3.  Precise estimation of the overall risk in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Criteria 1 and 2 aims to reduce the potential of overfitting. Criteria 3 aims to ensure the overall risk is estimated precisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Choose the number of candidate predictors of interest for inclusion in the model, and calculate the corresponding number of predictor parameters (p)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one predictor may require two or more parameters. For example, a k-category predictor requires k-1 parameters and a continuous predictor model with a non-linear trend requires more than one parameter to be estimated. Also include any potential interaction terms towards the total p.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a predictor selection method, p should be defined as the total number of parameters screened, and not just the subset that are included in the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming maximum total p to be 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The value of p is assumed to be no larger than 20 because univariate regression shows there are 20 variables that are significantly correlated with the outcome."

    "Harmonisation between datasets was mainly done via manually recording data to a standardized form. Data was then entered into an Excel spreadsheet. Data cleaning was done by handling duplicates, checking for missing values and inconsistencies. Multiple linezolid treatment episodes in the same patient were treated as duplicates and only the first episode was included in the analysis. Patients with missing values were excluded from subsequent analyses. Inconsistencies were resolved by referring back to the original records.\n",
