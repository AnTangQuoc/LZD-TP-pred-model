\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
\textbf{METHODS} & & & \\
\emph{Data} & 5a & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Describe the sources of data separately for the development and
evaluation datasets (e.g., randomised trial, cohort, routine care or
registry data), the rationale for using these data, and
representativeness of the data}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Provide a description of the source of the data used for model
  development and evaluation of model performance, including whether the
  data are (for example) from a randomised trial, a cohort, a registry
  or from electronic routine healthcare records}
\item
  \emph{Specify whether the study is using existing data or is
  prospectively collecting new data for the purpose of the prediction
  model study}
\item
  \emph{Where existing data are being used (i.e., they were originally
  collected for a different purpose), provide the rationale for using
  these data, and comment on the suitability (particularly if data are
  being used from a different setting or country to the intended target
  population) and representativeness of these data with respect to the
  intended target population and context}
\item
  \emph{A description of the data sources should be provided for all
  data sets, and separately for development and evaluation}
\item
  \emph{If any synthetic data have been used, then provide reasons as to
  why, and provide all details on how the synthetic data have been
  created (and code, see item 18f) and used in the study}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
& 5b & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Specify the dates of the collected participant data, including
start and end of participant accrual; and, if applicable, end of
follow-up}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Specify the start and end dates of the period for which the
  participants or the used data were selected}
\item
  \emph{For models predicting prognosis, the duration of follow-up is
  important so report the date of end of follow-up}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
\emph{Participants} & 6a & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Specify key elements of the study setting (e.g., primary care,
secondary care, general population) including the number and location of
centres}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Describe the healthcare setting, and where the participants in
  the study were recruited from}
\item
  \emph{Report the geographical location (at a minimum, the country) and
  centres (including the number of centres) of the study}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
& 6b & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Describe the eligibility criteria for study participants}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{The eligibility criteria for participants should be reported to
  understand the potential applicability and generalisability of the
  prediction model}
\item
  \emph{This includes reporting any restrictions of continuous
  variables, e.g., age range used to define the eligibility of the
  included participants}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
& 6c & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Give details of any treatments received, and how they were
handled during model development or evaluation, if relevant}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Any treatments received before or at the start of follow-up
  should be reported, and whether and how this was handled during the
  development or evaluation of the prediction model (if relevant)}
\item
  \emph{Any treatments received between the moment the prediction model
  is used and the measurement of the outcome, that could modify the
  probability of the outcome, should be reported (if relevant)}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
\emph{Data preparation} & 7 &
\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Describe any data pre-processing and quality checking, including
whether this was similar across relevant sociodemographic groups}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Describe any data cleaning steps, this includes any feature
  engineering, transformation of raw data, feature reduction and data
  quality checks. All code used for data cleaning should be made
  available (see item 18f)}
\item
  \emph{For analyses using data from multiple sources (e.g., data from
  different studies, cohorts, or registries), describe any harmonisation
  (e.g., of outcome and predictors)}
\item
  \emph{Confirm whether all data pre-processing/data cleaning steps were
  similar across key sociodemographic groups, if relevant}
\item
  \emph{If the data pre-processing/data cleaning steps are extensive,
  consider reporting this information in the supplementary material}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
& C-7b & \textbf{Describe the method for assessing risk of bias and
applicability in the individual clusters (eg, using PROBAST)} & \\
\emph{Outcomes} & 8a & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Clearly define the outcome that is being predicted and the time
horizon, including how and when assessed, the rationale for choosing
this outcome, and whether the method of outcome assessment is consistent
across sociodemographic groups}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{For diagnostic prediction models, the outcome should be clearly
  defined, including whether a (widely accepted) reference standard
  (ground truth) was used to determine the presence or absence of the
  outcome}
\item
  \emph{For prognostic models, i.e., models predicting an outcome in the
  future, authors should report the time-horizon of the outcome
  prediction. For example, predicting the 28-day risk of mortality
  following cardiothoracic surgery, or the 10-year risk of fractures in
  patients with osteoporosis. Also, the frequency of outcome assessment
  during follow-up should be reported}
\item
  \emph{If standard definitions are used, e.g., using ICD codes, this
  should be stated and referenced}
\item
  \emph{Any discrepancies in the outcome assessment across
  socio-demographic groups should be reported}
\item
  \emph{In some instances, it may be necessary to confirm that no
  predictors were used to define the outcome or are a proxy for the
  outcome}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
& 8b & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{If outcome assessment requires subjective interpretation,
describe the qualifications and demographic characteristics of the
outcome assessors}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{For outcomes that require a subjective interpretation (e.g.,
  interpreting the results from an imaging test, describe the number,
  qualification, and demographic characteristics of the outcome
  assessors)}
\item
  \emph{If the measurement and interpretation of the outcome require
  (additional) training or specific instructions, these should be
  reported.}
\item
  \emph{If extensive, consider reporting this information in the
  supplementary material}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
& 8c & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Report any actions to blind assessment of the outcome to be
predicted}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{The outcome being predicted should be assessed blind to
  information about the predictors -- particularly relevant for outcomes
  requiring a subjective interpretation thereby avoiding data (label)
  leakage}
\item
  \emph{If appropriate, authors should describe which information was
  available to the outcome assessors and report any specific actions to
  blinding the outcome assessment}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
\emph{Predictors} & 9a & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
Describe the choice of initial predictors (e.g., literature, previous
models, all available predictors) and any pre-selection of predictors
before model building

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Provide details on how the initial list of predictors were considered
  for inclusion in the model building, and whether they were chosen
  based on a (systematic) review of the literature, clinical input
  (domain experts), or simply whether using all predictors in the
  available data
\item
  If any pre-selection of predictors, before model building, was carried
  out, then provide details how this was done. For example, were
  predictors omitted for model building due to high amounts of missing
  data, or predictors not considered plausibly (clinically) related to
  the outcome being predicted
\item
  The list of initial predictors may be extensive, in these instances
  reporting these in the supplementary material is advisable
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
& 9b & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Clearly define all predictors, including how and when they were
measured (and any actions to blind assessment of predictors for the
outcome and other predictors)}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{All predictors included in the modelling should be clearly
  defined, along with units of measurement, and all categories for
  categorical predictors, so that readers and others can replicate,
  implement, or evaluate the performance of the model}
\item
  \emph{Details on how and when the predictor values were measured. Note
  that predictors should be measured before or at the time the model is
  intended to be used}
\item
  \emph{For predictors requiring subjective interpretation, it may be
  important to interpret this blind to the values of other predictors
  considered in the modelling (e.g., avoiding data leakage). Authors
  should report any actions to blind the assessment of the predictor
  measurement to other predictors}
\item
  \emph{Specifically for diagnostic models, the measurement of the
  predictors should be done without knowledge of the outcome of the
  individual as this could artificially inflate the association between
  the predictors and the outcome. Authors should report any actions to
  blind the assessment of the predictor measurements to the outcome
  value}
\item
  \emph{In some instances, the number of predictors can be very large
  and thus reporting them all in the main manuscript is unhelpful, in
  these instances, it is still important to clearly define all the
  predictors, and reporting this in the supplementary material should be
  considered}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
& 9c & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{If predictor measurement requires subjective interpretation,
describe the qualifications and demographic characteristics of the
predictor assessors}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{For predictors that require a subjective interpretation (e.g.,
  interpreting the results from an imaging test), the qualifications and
  demographic characteristics of the predictor assessors should be
  reported}
\item
  \emph{If the measurement and interpretation require (additional)
  training or specific instructions, then these should be reported. This
  could be reported in the supplementary material}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
\emph{Sample size} & 10 & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Explain how the study size was arrived at (separately for
development and evaluation), and justify that the study size was
sufficient to answer the research question. Include details of any
sample size calculation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Describe how the sample size was determined -- this should be
  done separately for determining the sample size needed for model
  development and the sample size needed to evaluate the performance of
  the model irrespective of whether data are being prospectively
  collected or using existing data}
\item
  \emph{Provide details and all estimates used in any sample size
  calculation}
\item
  \emph{If no formal sample size calculation was done, e.g., all
  available data were used, provide a justification whether the size of
  the data was sufficient to answer the research question}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
\emph{Missing data} & 11 & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Describe how missing data were handled. Provide reasons for
omitting any data}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Missing data is an omnipresent problem. Authors should report
  for each predictor being considered for inclusion in the model the
  number of missing values}
\item
  \emph{The handling of missing values should be reported, including any
  assumptions for the reason of the missingness}
\item
  \emph{If individuals (or predictors) have been omitted due to the
  missing values, this should be reported, and reasons given}
\item
  \emph{If missing values have been imputed, then full details of the
  method for imputing any missing values should be reported}
\item
  \emph{If missing values have been imputed confirm it was done
  separately for the training and any test data (i.e., avoiding
  leakage)}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
\emph{Analytical methods} & 12a &
\begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Describe how the data were used (e.g., for development and
evaluation of model performance) in the analysis, including whether the
data were partitioned, considering any sample size requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Describe how the available data were used to develop the model
  and to evaluate model performance, including whether and how the data
  were partitioned, and the reasons for partitioning the data (e.g.,
  model development, hyperparameter tuning, evaluating model
  performance, internal-external cross-validation)}
\item
  \emph{If the data has been partitioned, report whether sample size
  requirements (see item 10) were considered during the partitioning,
  and whether the size of the partitioned data are sufficient to carry
  out the analyses and answer the research question}
\item
  \emph{If the data has been partitioned into training (including any
  hyperparameter tuning data) and test data, confirm that there has been
  no data leakage}
\item
  \emph{If the data contain multiple records or samples from the same
  individual, and if the data has been partitioned into training
  (including any hyperparameter tuning data) and test data, confirm
  there has been no leakage of individuals across any of the partitioned
  data or if not, how describe how this was handled in the analysis (see
  item 12c)}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
& 12b & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Depending on the type of model, describe how predictors were
handled in the analyses (functional form, rescaling, transformation, or
any standardisation)}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{For any predictors that have been transformed during the
  analysis, i.e., rescaled, or standardised, describe how this was done}
\item
  \emph{For any categorical predictors, where collapsing of categories
  has been carried out, e.g., due to small sample size/too few outcome
  events, provide the details and reasons}
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage} & \\
& 12c & \begin{minipage}[t]{\linewidth}\raggedright
\textbf{Specify the type of model, rationale (separately for all model
buiding approaches), all model-building steps, including any
hyperparameter tuning, and method for internal validation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Clearly specify the type of model (or models) being developed
  (e.g., logistic regression, Cox regression, random forest, neural
  network) and provide a rationale for using each model building method
  -- consider the type of outcome being predicted and how the prediction
  model will be implemented in practice}
\item
  \emph{For each model, clearly describe all the steps in the model
  building, including any hyperparameter tuning, what hyperparameters
  have been tuned and how this was done. If many model building
  approaches are being applied and word limits prohibit a full
  description, then use supplementary material to provide the details}
\item
  \emph{For studies that are developing more than one model (e.g., using
  different model building methods), clearly describe the criteria to
  choose which is the model being put forward (if any), see item 12e and
  item 23 on model performance)}
\item
  \emph{The internal validation approach (to evaluate model performance)

prediction model, including references to existing
models}\label{a.-explain-the-healthcare-context-including-whether-diagnostic-or-prognostic-and-rationale-for-developing-or-evaluating-the-prediction-model-including-references-to-existing-models}

\textbf{First paragraph:} introduction about linezolid and associated
ADR including thrombocytopenia

\textbf{Second paragraph:} what is already known in the literature about
this association (magnitude and associated factors)

\textbf{Third paragraph:} the importance of investigation this
association in Vietnamese settings and develop a risk prediction model.
Why is this study needed?

This study aimed to develop and validate a risk prediction model of
linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia adapted to Vietnamese setting. In
addition, we constructed a simplified risk score using this model to
enhance the applicability of the prediction rule in clinical practice.

This study used data from three tertiary hospitals in Northern Vietnam:
Thanh Nhan Hospital, Bach Mai Hospital, and the National Hospital of
Tropical Diseases. Patients hospitalized and treated with linezolid were
included. The following patients were excluded: (i) those under 18 years
of age; (ii) those treated with linezolid for less than 3 days; (iii)
those without any recorded platelet count in the period before or after
initiation of linezolid therapy; (iv) those with baseline platelet count
of \textgreater{} 450 x 10\textsuperscript{9} cells/L; (v) those with
any missing recorded values among the specified predictors. Each patient
was included only once per admission and the first linezolid treatment
course was evaluated. Included patients were followed up until the end
of the linezolid treatment course or discharge date whichever comes
first.

\subsubsection{5b. Specify the dates of the collected participant data,

The data was collected from each hospital in two phases: a pilot phase
and an extension phase. In the pilot phase, we requested existing
datasets at the hospitals. In the extension phase, additional data was
collected prospectively. Data was extracted from the electronic medical
records of the hospitals, except for the pilot dataset at Bach Mai
Hospital which was extracted from physical records. In order to
harmonise different datasets, data was filled out in a paper form and
stored in Excel.

The pilot datasets were collected from January 01 to June 30, 2020 at
Thanh Nhan Hospital; from November 01 to December 31, 2019 at Bach Mai
Hospital; from May 01 to December 31, 2021 at the National Hospital of
Tropical Diseases. The extension datasets were collected from September
01, 2022 to March 31, 2023 at Thanh Nhan Hospital; from December 01,
2022 to March 31, 2023 at Bach Mai Hospital; from April 01 to September
31, 2022 at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases. \emph{(comment:
no data of total number of patients admitted to these hospitals during
each period)}

The anonymized data were extracted from electronical medical records at
each medical institution, except data from Bach Mai Hospital in the
pilot phase. Individual ID number were assigned to each patient's
hospital admission.

Ethical approval was obtained from\ldots.

The outcome of interest is linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia, defined
as (i) a platelet count of \textless{} 112.5 x 10\textsuperscript{9}
cells/L (75\% of the lower limit of normal) for patients with a baseline
platelet count in the normal range; (ii) A reduction in platelet count
of ≥ 25\% from the baseline value for patients with a baseline platelet
count of \textless{} 150 x 10\textsuperscript{9} cells/L {[}1--3{]}.

Normal platelet count is defined as 150-450 x 10\textsuperscript{9}
cells/L. Baseline platelet count is defined as the last recorded PLT
value before the start of linezolid therapy. Participants are considered
to have met the outcome if their platelet count value meets the above
criteria at any time during linezolid therapy or within 5 days after the
end of therapy.

Thrombocytopenia may occur within a few days after stopping LZD, when
the drug hasn't been completely eliminated. However, it is unknown
exactly how long after stopping LZD can a TP event still be attributed
to LZD use. We deemed that any TP events that occur after 5 days of
stopping LZD would not be related to LZD use.

Our rationale is that after 5 days (120 hrs), LZD is guaranteed to be
completely eliminated in all patients, as the longest
t\textsubscript{1/2} is 8.3 ± 2.4 hrs in end-stage renal disease
patients, +3 SD would be \textasciitilde16 hrs, so 120 hrs is
\textgreater7 half-lives, therefore in patients with the worst
clearance, 99\% of them would have 99\% of the drug eliminated from
their systems. Furthermore, trough LZD concentration
(C\textsubscript{min}) has previously been identified as a predictor of
LI-TP development, and LI-TP itself is mostly reversible after
discontinuation, so we would argue that any TP events that occur after
LZD has been eliminated from the system would not be related to LZD use.

Predictors will be screened for inclusion in the model if they meet all
of the following criteria: (i) has been identified as a risk factor of
LI-TP in previous studies; (ii) can be collected or evaluated from the

drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia as an adverse drug reaction with a
frequency of at least \textgreater{} 1/1000 in the drug label or

Previous studies developing logistic regression models for LI-TP risk
predictions have included 4-6 predictors in their final models
{[}2,4--6{]}. We expect to include about as many candidate predictors,
based on results from the expert opinion survey and the Bayesian Model
Selection algorithm. Some of the candidate predictors might be
continuous, which may potentially require non-linear modelling and
therefore slightly increase the number of variables.

A general rule of thumb is for at least 10 events be available for each
candidate predictor considered in a prediction model {[}7{]}. We have a
total of 816 eligible patients and 264 of those have experienced the
outcome. If the number of candidate predictors is 7, we would have 37
events per candidate predictor, which is considerably greater than the
minimum number required. Even if the number of parameters screened is
20, we would still have 13 events per candidate predictor.

However, the aforementioned rule of thumb have generated some debate in
the literature, with recent results suggesting that event per variable
criterion is too simplistic and has no strong relation to the predictive
performance of a model. Riley et al {[}8{]} proposed a different set of
criteria to estimate minimum sample size for models developed using
logistic regression, which are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Small optimism in predictor effect estimates, defined as a global
  shrinkage factor of \textgreater= 0.9.
\item
  Small absolute difference of \textless= 0.05 in the model's apparent
  and adjusted Nagelkerke's R-squared.
\item
  Precise estimation of the overall risk in the population.
\end{enumerate}

Criteria 1 and 2 aims to reduce the potential of overfitting. Criteria 3
aims to ensure the overall risk is estimated precisely.

\paragraph{Step 1: Choose the number of candidate predictors of interest
for inclusion in the model, and calculate the corresponding number of
predictor parameters
(p)}\label{step-1-choose-the-number-of-candidate-predictors-of-interest-for-inclusion-in-the-model-and-calculate-the-corresponding-number-of-predictor-parameters-p}

Note that one predictor may require two or more parameters. For example,
a k-category predictor requires k-1 parameters and a continuous
predictor model with a non-linear trend requires more than one parameter
to be estimated. Also include any potential interaction terms towards
the total p.

When using a predictor selection method, p should be defined as the
total number of parameters screened, and not just the subset that are
included in the final model.

Assuming maximum total p to be 20.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, titlerule=0mm, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, breakable, opacitybacktitle=0.6, leftrule=.75mm, arc=.35mm, coltitle=black, left=2mm, rightrule=.15mm, opacityback=0, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, colback=white, toprule=.15mm, bottomrule=.15mm, toptitle=1mm, bottomtitle=1mm]

The value of p is assumed to be no larger than 20 because univariate
regression shows there are 20 variables that are significantly
correlated with the outcome.

The value of max(R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{CS\_app}) is based
on the overall prevalence or overall rate of the outcome in the
population of interest. The incidence of LI-TP in patients treated with
linezolid was estimated to be 37\% in a meta-analysis by Zhao et al
{[}9{]}.

The value of R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{CS\_adj} could be based
on that for a previously published model in the same setting and
population (with similar outcome definition). However, as previous
studies does not provide any information to identify a sensible value of
the minimum expected Cox-Snell R\textsuperscript{2}, the value
R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{CS\_adj} will be assumed to
correspond to a R\textsuperscript{2}\textsubscript{Nagelkerke} of 0.50,
as baseline platelet count, a ``direct'' measurement of the outcome, is
likely to be a predictor.

\paragraph{Step 3: Criterion 1}\label{step-3-criterion-1}

Calculate the sample size required to ensure Van Houwelingen's global
shrinkage factor (S\textsubscript{VH}) is close to 1. A value of
S\textsubscript{VH} \textgreater= 0.90 is generally recommended, which
reflects a small amount of overfitting during model development.

\paragraph{Step 4: Criterion 2}\label{step-4-criterion-2}

Calculate the shrinkage factor (S\textsubscript{VH}) required to ensure
a small absolute difference of \textless= 0.05 in the developed model's

required sample size conditional on this value of S\textsubscript{VH}.

Calculate the sample size required to ensure a precise estimate of the

The required minimum sample size is the maximum value from steps 3 to 5,

The final estimate of minimum sample size is 775, therefore our data is
sufficient for model development with 20 parameters.

The maximum number of parameters that can be screened is 21.

Harmonisation between datasets was mainly done via manually recording
data to a standardized form. Data was then entered into an Excel
spreadsheet. Data cleaning was done by handling duplicates, checking for
missing values and inconsistencies. Multiple linezolid treatment
episodes in the same patient were treated as duplicates and only the
first episode was included in the analysis. Patients with missing values
were excluded from subsequent analyses. Inconsistencies were resolved by
referring back to the original records.
