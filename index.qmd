# Introduction

## Background

### 3a. Explain the healthcare context (including whether diagnostic or prognostic) and rationale for developing or evaluating the prediction model, including references to existing models

**First paragraph:** introduction about linezolid and associated ADR including thrombocytopenia

**Second paragraph:** what is already known in the literature about this association (magnitude and associated factors)

**Third paragraph:** the importance of investigation this association in Vietnamese settings and develop a risk prediction model. Why is this study needed?

This study aimed to develop and validate a risk prediction model of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia adapted to Vietnamese setting. In addition, we constructed a simplified risk score using this model to enhance the applicability of the prediction rule in clinical practice.

### 3b. Describe the target population and the intended purpose of the prediction model in the context of the care pathway, including its intended users (e.g., healthcare professionals, patients, public)

### 3c. Describe any known health inequalities between sociodemographic groups

## Objectives

### 4. Specify the study objectives, including whether the study describes the development or validation of a prediction model (or both)

# Methods

## Data

### 5a. Describe the sources of data separately for the development and evaluation datasets (e.g., randomised trial, cohort, routine care or registry data), the rationale for using these data, and representativeness of the data

This study used data from three tertiary hospitals in Northern Vietnam: Thanh Nhan Hospital, Bach Mai Hospital, and the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases. Patients hospitalized and treated with linezolid were included. The following patients were excluded: (i) those under 18 years of age; (ii) those treated with linezolid for less than 3 days; (iii) those without any recorded platelet count in the period before or after initiation of linezolid therapy; (iv) those with baseline platelet count of \> 450 x 10^9^ cells/L; (v) those with any missing recorded values among the specified predictors. Each patient was included only once per admission and the first linezolid treatment course was evaluated. Included patients were followed up until the end of the linezolid treatment course or discharge date whichever comes first.

### 5b. Specify the dates of the collected participant data, including start and end of participant accrual; and, if applicable, end of follow-up

The data was collected from each hospital in two phases: a pilot phase and an extension phase. In the pilot phase, we requested existing datasets at the hospitals. In the extension phase, additional data was collected prospectively. Data was extracted from the electronic medical records of the hospitals, except for the pilot dataset at Bach Mai Hospital which was extracted from physical records. In order to harmonise different datasets, data was filled out in a paper form and stored in Excel.

The pilot datasets were collected from January 01 to June 30, 2020 at Thanh Nhan Hospital; from November 01 to December 31, 2019 at Bach Mai Hospital; from May 01 to December 31, 2021 at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases. The extension datasets were collected from September 01, 2022 to March 31, 2023 at Thanh Nhan Hospital; from December 01, 2022 to March 31, 2023 at Bach Mai Hospital; from April 01 to September 31, 2022 at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases. *(comment: no data of total number of patients admitted to these hospitals during each period)*

The anonymized data were extracted from electronical medical records at each medical institution, except data from Bach Mai Hospital in the pilot phase. Individual ID number were assigned to each patient's hospital admission.

Ethical approval was obtained from....

## Participants

### 6a. Specify key elements of the study setting (e.g., primary care, secondary care, general population) including the number and location of centres

### 6b. Describe the eligibility criteria for study participants

### 6c. Give details of any treatments received, and how they were handled during model development or evaluation, if relevant

## Data preparation

### 7. Describe any data pre-processing and quality checking, including whether this was similar across relevant sociodemographic groups

### C-7b. Describe the method for assessing risk of bias and applicability in the individual clusters (eg, using PROBAST)

## Outcome

### 8a. Clearly define the outcome that is being predicted and the time horizon, including how and when assessed, the rationale for choosing this outcome, and whether the method of outcome assessment is consistent across sociodemographic groups

The outcome of interest is linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia, defined as (i) a platelet count of \< 112.5 x 10^9^ cells/L (75% of the lower limit of normal) for patients with a baseline platelet count in the normal range; (ii) A reduction in platelet count of ≥ 25% from the baseline value for patients with a baseline platelet count of \< 150 x 10^9^ cells/L [@zyvoxpr; @xu_establishment_2023; @kawasuji_proposal_2021].

Normal platelet count is defined as 150-450 x 10^9^ cells/L. Baseline platelet count is defined as the last recorded PLT value before the start of linezolid therapy. Participants are considered to have met the outcome if their platelet count value meets the above criteria at any time during linezolid therapy or within 5 days after the end of therapy.

::: callout-warning
Thrombocytopenia may occur within a few days after stopping LZD, when the drug hasn't been completely eliminated. However, it is unknown exactly how long after stopping LZD can a TP event still be attributed to LZD use. We deemed that any TP events that occur after 5 days of stopping LZD would not be related to LZD use.

Our rationale is that after 5 days (120 hrs), LZD is guaranteed to be completely eliminated in all patients, as the longest t~1/2~ is 8.3 ± 2.4 hrs in end-stage renal disease patients, +3 SD would be \~16 hrs, so 120 hrs is \>7 half-lives, therefore in patients with the worst clearance, 99% of them would have 99% of the drug eliminated from their systems. Furthermore, trough LZD concentration (C~min~) has previously been identified as a predictor of LI-TP development, and LI-TP itself is mostly reversible after discontinuation, so we would argue that any TP events that occur after LZD has been eliminated from the system would not be related to LZD use.

### 8b. If outcome assessment requires subjective interpretation, describe the qualifications and demographic characteristics of the outcome assessors

### 8c. Report any actions to blind assessment of the outcome to be predicted

## Predictors

### 9a. Describe the choice of initial predictors (e.g., literature, previous models, all available predictors) and any pre-selection of predictors before model building

### 9b. Clearly define all predictors, including how and when they were measured (and any actions to blind assessment of predictors for the outcome and other predictors)

Predictors will be screened for inclusion in the model if they meet all of the following criteria: (i) has been identified as a risk factor of LI-TP in previous studies; (ii) can be collected or evaluated from the information in the datasets; (iii) for concomitant medications, has drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia as an adverse drug reaction with a frequency of at least \> 1/1000 in the drug label or Micromedex; (iv) has consensus from a clinical expert panel as possibly related to LI-TP development.

The following information was extracted from all records:

-   Patient demographics
-   Clinical department where linezolid was initiated.
-   Co-morbidities
-   Invasive procedures performed
-   Infection type
-   Laboratory results
-   Linezolid route of administration
-   Linezolid dose in milligrams.
-   Linezolid duration, defined as the number of days from the first to the last dose of linezolid.
-   Concomitant medications during linezolid therapy

### 9c. If predictor measurement requires subjective interpretation, describe the qualifications and demographic characteristics of the predictor assessors

## Sample size

### 10. Explain how the study size was arrived at (separately for development and evaluation), and justify that the study size was sufficient to answer the research question. Include details of any sample size calculation

Previous studies developing logistic regression models for LI-TP risk predictions have included 4-6 predictors in their final models [@liu_analysis_2021; @duan_regression_2022; @qin_development_2021; @xu_establishment_2023]. We expect to include about as many candidate predictors, based on results from the expert opinion survey and the Bayesian Model Selection algorithm. Some of the candidate predictors might be continuous, which may potentially require non-linear modelling and therefore slightly increase the number of variables.

A general rule of thumb is for at least 10 events be available for each candidate predictor considered in a prediction model @peduzzi1995. We have a total of 816 eligible patients and 264 of those have experienced the outcome. If the number of candidate predictors is 7, we would have 37 events per candidate predictor, which is considerably greater than the minimum number required. Even if the number of parameters screened is 20, we would still have 13 events per candidate predictor.

However, the aforementioned rule of thumb have generated some debate in the literature, with recent results suggesting that event per variable criterion is too simplistic and has no strong relation to the predictive performance of a model. Riley et al @riley2019 proposed a different set of criteria to estimate minimum sample size for models developed using logistic regression, which are the following:

1.  Small optimism in predictor effect estimates, defined as a global shrinkage factor of \>= 0.9.
2.  Small absolute difference of \<= 0.05 in the model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's R-squared.
3.  Precise estimation of the overall risk in the population.

Criteria 1 and 2 aims to reduce the potential of overfitting. Criteria 3 aims to ensure the overall risk is estimated precisely.

#### Step 1: Choose the number of candidate predictors of interest for inclusion in the model, and calculate the corresponding number of predictor parameters (p)

Note that one predictor may require two or more parameters. For example, a k-category predictor requires k-1 parameters and a continuous predictor model with a non-linear trend requires more than one parameter to be estimated. Also include any potential interaction terms towards the total p.

When using a predictor selection method, p should be defined as the total number of parameters screened, and not just the subset that are included in the final model.

Assuming maximum total p to be 20.

::: callout-note
The value of p is assumed to be no larger than 20 because univariate regression shows there are 20 variables that are significantly correlated with the outcome.
:::

```{r}
parameter_number <- 20
sample_size <- 816
```

#### Step 2: Choose sensible values for R^2^~CS_adj~ and max(R^2^~CS_app~) based on previous studies where R^2^~CS~ is the Cox-Snell R^2^ statistic.

The value of max(R^2^~CS_app~) is based on the overall prevalence or overall rate of the outcome in the population of interest. The incidence of LI-TP in patients treated with linezolid was estimated to be 37% in a meta-analysis by Zhao et al @zhao_prediction_2024.

The value of R^2^~CS_adj~ could be based on that for a previously published model in the same setting and population (with similar outcome definition). However, as previous studies does not provide any information to identify a sensible value of the minimum expected Cox-Snell R^2^, the value R^2^~CS_adj~ will be assumed to correspond to a R^2^~Nagelkerke~ of 0.50, as baseline platelet count, a "direct" measurement of the outcome, is likely to be a predictor.

```{r}
calculate_R2_CS_adj <- function(n = 100, E, R2_N = 0.15) {
  ln_L_null <- E * log(E / n) + (n - E) * log(1 - E / n)
  max_R2_CS_app <- 1 - exp(2 * ln_L_null / n)
  R2_CS_adj <- R2_N / max_R2_CS_app
  return(list(R2_CS_adj = R2_CS_adj, max_R2_CS_app = max_R2_CS_app))
}

(cox_snell_r2 <- calculate_R2_CS_adj(E = 37)$R2_CS_adj)
max_apparent_cox_snell_r2 <- calculate_R2_CS_adj(E = 37)$max_R2_CS_app
```

#### Step 3: Criterion 1

Calculate the sample size required to ensure Van Houwelingen's global shrinkage factor (S~VH~) is close to 1. A value of S~VH~ \>= 0.90 is generally recommended, which reflects a small amount of overfitting during model development.

```{r}
calculate_sample_size_1 <- function(p, R2_CS_adj, S_VH = 0.90) {
  n <- p / ((S_VH - 1) * log(1 - R2_CS_adj / S_VH))
  return(n)
}

(
  sample_size_criterion_1 <-
    calculate_sample_size_1(
      p = parameter_number,
      R2_CS_adj = cox_snell_r2
    ) |> ceiling()
)

calculate_param_limit_1 <- function(n, R2_CS_adj, S_VH = 0.90) {
  p <- n * ((S_VH - 1) * log(1 - R2_CS_adj / S_VH))
  return(p)
}

(
  parameter_limit_1 <- calculate_param_limit_1(
    n = sample_size,
    R2_CS_adj = cox_snell_r2
  ) |> floor()
)

```

We see that `r sample_size_criterion_1` participants are required to meet criterion 1.

#### Step 4: Criterion 2

Calculate the shrinkage factor (S~VH~) required to ensure a small absolute difference of \<= 0.05 in the developed model's apparent and adjusted Nagelkerke's R^2^. Then derive the required sample size conditional on this value of S~VH~.

```{r}
calculate_sample_size_2 <- function(p, R2_CS_adj, max_R2_CS_app, delta = 0.05) {
  S_VH <- R2_CS_adj / (R2_CS_adj + delta * max_R2_CS_app)
  n <- p / ((S_VH - 1) * log(1 - R2_CS_adj / S_VH))
  return(n)
}

(
  sample_size_criterion_2 <-
    calculate_sample_size_2(
      p = parameter_number,
      R2_CS_adj = cox_snell_r2,
      max_R2_CS_app = max_apparent_cox_snell_r2
    ) |> ceiling()
)

calculate_param_limit_2 <- function(n, R2_CS_adj, max_R2_CS_app, delta = 0.05) {
  S_VH <- R2_CS_adj / (R2_CS_adj + delta * max_R2_CS_app)
  p <- n * ((S_VH - 1) * log(1 - R2_CS_adj / S_VH))
  return(p)
}

(
  parameter_limit_2 <- calculate_param_limit_2(
    n = sample_size,
    R2_CS_adj = cox_snell_r2,
    max_R2_CS_app = max_apparent_cox_snell_r2
  ) |> floor()
) 

```

We see that `r sample_size_criterion_2` participants are required to meet criterion 2.

#### Step 5: Criterion 3

Calculate the sample size required to ensure a precise estimate of the overall risk in the population. The suggested absolute margin of error is \<= 0.05.

```{r}
calculate_sample_size_3 <- function(phi_hat, delta = 0.05) {
  n <- (1.96 / delta)^2 * phi_hat * (1 - phi_hat)
  return(n)
}

(
  sample_size_criterion_3 <-
    calculate_sample_size_3(phi_hat = 0.37) |> ceiling()
)
```

We see that `r sample_size_criterion_3` participants are required to meet criterion 3.

#### Step 6: Final sample size

The required minimum sample size is the maximum value from steps 3 to 5, to ensure that each of criteria 1 to 3 are met.

```{r}
(minimum_sample_size <- max(sample_size_criterion_1, sample_size_criterion_2, sample_size_criterion_3))
(maximum_parameter_limit <- min(parameter_limit_1, parameter_limit_2))
```

The final estimate of minimum sample size is `r minimum_sample_size`, therefore our data is sufficient for model development with 20 parameters.

The maximum number of parameters that can be screened is `r maximum_parameter_limit`.

Multiple linezolid treatment episodes in the same patient were treated as duplicates and only the first episode was included in the analysis. Patients with missing values were excluded from subsequent analyses. Inconsistencies were resolved by referring back to the original records.

Before analysis, the extracted predictors are limited to those that meet criteria (i) to (iii) in the previous section:

-   Invasive procedures were recorded into binary variables: endotracheal intubation, central venous catheter insertion, intermittent hemodialysis, and continuous renal replacement therapy.
-   Infection type was recorded into binary variables: community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infection, central nervous system infection, intra-abdominal infection, urinary tract infection, bone and joint infection, septicemia, and sepsis.
-   Laboratory results were limited to serum creatinine, hemoglobin count, white blood cell count, and platelet count. Creatinine clearance was estimated from serum creatinine using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.
